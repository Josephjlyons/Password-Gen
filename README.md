Simple HTML/CSS/JS coding was used, also the use of Bootstrap was included in this project.

Simply adjust the slide bar to select length of the password you desire from a min of 8 characters to a max of 128 characters. Once you have selected a length click generate and your password will appear in the text box. If you would like a more defined password with only certain character types use a checkbox to select or deselect.
