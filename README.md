# Password-Gen

## Purpose

The purpose of this project was to created a random password generator that abides by certain criteria. However I was unable at this time to perfectly follow what was asked for this project and after many hours of trying to figure out how to get it right... I will have to admit defeat, only for now. I do plan to revist and polish up this project to make sure it fully works to the upmost standards. 

### Codes 
Simple HTML/CSS/JS coding was used, also the use of Bootstrap was included in this project. 

### How to Use 
Simply adjust the slide bar to select length of the password you desire from a min of 8 characters to a max of 128 characters. Once you have selected a length click generate and your password will appear in the text box. 

Currently the ability to select and de-select certain characters (upper,lower,numbers,symbols) is not available.
